# FunWithpwsh
A collection of useful powershell commands and scripts that I hope to build into a package.

Things I want this to do: 

- Have a function for going out in AD and resetting a user's password to a specified default, and force reset on next login. 
- Input a computer name and check for that computer's most recent user (check user accounts for recently altered, or recent user logon, possibly wmi query?)
- Run an sfc scan remotely (and other utilities)
