# FunWithpwsh
A collection of useful powershell commands and scripts that I hope to build into a package.

Things I want this to do: 

- Reset users password in AD to a specified default, and force reset on next login. 
- Get last users logon date when given PC number input 
- Run an sfc scan remotely (and other utilities)
- Easily execute remoting over SSH
